Program Name:

Program Description:

write a program that reads a list of integers from input into an array 
and 
outputs "yes" if the list is sorted in ascending order between two provided positions. 
Otherwise, output "no". 

The first input specifies the number of items in the list. 
The next set of inputs is the list. 
The last two inputs are the start and end positions (inclusive, between 0 and count where count is the number of values in the array). Assume the list contains no more than 20 integers and position 0 is the first element.&nbsp;

Ex: If the input is:

Number of integers: 8 
Enter the values: 5 6 7 4 3 2 1 0
Enter start and end index: 0 2

the output is:

yes


Ex: If the input is:

Number of integers: 6
Enter the values: 1 2 3 4 5 2
Enter start and end index: 2 5

the output is:
no


Design:
A. INPUT
Define the input variables including name data type. 

B. OUTPUT
Define the output variables including data types. 

C. CALCULATIONS
Describe calculations used by algorithms in step D.  
List all formulas. 
If there are no calculations needed, state there are no calculations.

D. LOGIC and ALGORITHMS
Design the logic of your program using pseudocode or flowcharts. 
Use conditionals, loops, functions or array constructs.
List the steps in transforming inputs into outputs.

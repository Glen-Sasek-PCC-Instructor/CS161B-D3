With your programming partner, write a program that reads a list of integers from input into an array and outputs "yes" if the list is sorted in ascending order between two provided positions. Otherwise, output "no". The first input specifies the number of items in the list. The next set of inputs is the list. The last two inputs are the start and end positions (inclusive, between 0 and count where count is the number of values in the array). Assume the list contains no more than 20 integers and position 0 is the first element.&nbsp;

Ex: If the input is:

Number of integers: 8 
Enter the values: 5 6 7 4 3 2 1 0
Enter start and end index: 0 2


the output is:

yes


Ex: If the input is:

Number of integers: 6&nbsp;
Enter the values: 1 2 3 4 5 2
Enter start and end index: 2 5


the output is:

no


Task:

Open this Replit and make a copy.
Click on the Files icon -&gt; design.doc and plan the steps of your algorithm.
Start with the end - design what the user will see when they run your program.
Design first, then write your C++ program.
Update the program header with both partner names and other information, and post a link to your Replit on this discussion topic.
Must have at least 2 functions other than main. Must use a for loop to read input and to check if the list is sorted.
